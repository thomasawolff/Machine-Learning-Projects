# Nueral-Network-Projects
This repository has code from either online tutorials about nueral networks or from a course on Udemy.com. The Udemy course the covers nueral networks and deep learning on Tensorflow and is done by Jose Portilla. Most of the code are reproductions from code-alongs with changes made myself.
